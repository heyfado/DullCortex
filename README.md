## " A quick way to fix Razer Synapse"

Hello,
This is a quick script I threw together to remove the Razer Game Manager (& Service) from my computer.
It deletes the folder & files, and removes the registry entries.
It then patches the registry key dependency baked in to Razer Synapse.
*** IT THEN WILL RESTART THE SYSTEM! ***
This program requires being run as administrator, and is supposed to trigger a UAC prompt ("run as administrator") when launched.

Code is simple, commented, and *decently* readable, feel free to tweak it on your own, or suggest changes here!
Excuse the dumb parody name, as I forgot Razer already had a product called Razer Cortex.
